== What Is it? ==

Just a very short irssi script based on hilightwin.pl (another irssi script)
that logs your own messages (instead of hilighted messages) to a separate
window, named "schitzo".

See http://castopulence.org/schitzwin/ for more.

== How Do I Use It? ==

You use it like any other irssi script. "Install" (read: copy) it into
your irssi scripts directory and execute the following command in irssi:

/script load schitzwin.pl

If you want the script to run automatically then symlink (or copy) it into
the scripts/autorun directory (create if it doesn't exist yet).

To actually see the output you will need to also create a window and name
it "schitzo". I did this with the following commands:

/window new split
/window name schitzo
/window size 2

Whether or not you want to use a split or hidden window is entirely up to
you. The script doesn't know or care. The name is really all that matters.
The size is also arbitrary. I just didn't want it taking up more space
than necessary.

I also saved my layout so that every time I run irssi it will
automatically create my schitzo window for me.

/layout save
/save

(I'm not sure if the /save is necessary, but it shouldn't hurt unless you
have settings you don't want saved)

== License / Etc. ==

The script is released under the terms of the GNU GPL version 2 or later.
Be sure to familiarize yourself with the license. :)
